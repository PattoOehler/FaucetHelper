# FaucetHelper
Assists in long term use of bitcoin and alt-coin faucets


To use run New_Faucets.jar with java -jar New_Faucets.jar
this will create 2 files with the default options.  
Pressing enter will open the website in chrome with the profile directed in Options.txt

Faucets.csv is a csv file with each line containing
Website,timeinseconds,priority,
priority is just what ranking it should have, you can easily use this as how many shatoshis you get on the site
timeinseconds is how long it will take until you can go back and redeem more bitcoins
the website is where it goes

Options.txt is the options that go into running such as the profiles chrome uses and if you want to use multiple profiles
